some of the action scenes were very interesting tense and well done
i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it
a very tense action scene that seemed well done
some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography unusual colors or interesting angles
also the film is funny is several parts
i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too
i would give the film an 8 out of 10
